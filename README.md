### TALKY APP

## BDD

- As a user, I would like to vote on the pitch they liked and give it a downvote or upvote
- As a user, I would like to be signed in for me to leave a comment
- As a user, I would like to receive a welcoming email once I sign up.
- As a user, I would like to view the pitches I have created in my profile page.
